      Now the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. And the Lordcommanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land. Jonah, however, was stuck and needed a ride, so he sends a message in a bottle back into the sea.

      <p>Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming, “Forty more

      didn't work the way he thought it would, and he ended up saying something
      completely different. </p>
