      <h2>Jonah Goes to Nineveh</h2>
      <p>Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming, “Forty more
      days and Nineveh will be overthrown.” Unfortunately, the megaphone he used
      didn't work the way he thought it would, and he ended up saying something
      completely different. Try and decipher Jonah's true message.</p>
