            I'm going to leave from the port of Jaffa (Now part of Tel Aviv)
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to be somewhat discreet, so I think I will try and take a
            good number of flight transfers
          </li>
          <li>
            I've marked all possible destinations and transfer locations on the
            map
          </li>
          <li>I don't want to visit the same place twice (why?)</li>
          <li>I want to visit Asia only once</li>
          <li>
            I want to avoid long flights until absolutely necessary, so with
            exceptions to my last flight, I want all my flights to be within 11
            hours long.
          </li>
          <li>
            My last flight is going to be pretty nasty. It's a ~15 hour flight
            that crosses the Atlantic Ocean.

        Now the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the
        belly of the fish three days and three nights. From the fish's belly, he
        sent out a weird message in a bottle. Decipher his message.

      <ul>
        <li>
          And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.

        <li>From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God.</li>

          You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas, and
          the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over
          me.
        </li>
        <li>
          He said: “In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me.
          From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and you listened
          to my cry.

        <li>.</li>
        <li>
          But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you. What I
          have vowed I will make good. I will say, ‘Salvation comes from the
          Lord.’ ”
        </li>
        <li>
          To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me
          in forever. But you, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit.
